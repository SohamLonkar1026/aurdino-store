Build a professional full-stack e-commerce website called "ArduinoMart" to sell Arduino parts and kits.

---

🎯 Homepage (Make it large, clean, futuristic, and deep blue themed):
- Big hero banner: “Build Amazing Projects with Arduino”
- Tagline: “A VIT-Based Startup”
- Use gradient blues and modern fonts
- Add section: “Why Buy From Us Instead of Big Dealers” with these points:
   1. Because we’re just a small startup.
   2. We don’t have a warehouse — so no need to earn more per kit.
   3. Admin has no girlfriend — even less money required.
   4. Admin only needs money for Friday night.
- Highlight the Arduino Starter Kit (₹1250) in a featured box
- Add attractive placeholder images of Arduino projects
- Include a button to slide to other sections like Products, About, Contact, and Admin
